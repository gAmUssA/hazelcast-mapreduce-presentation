# Hazelcast Map Reduce Tutorial Code
This codebase is part of the Hazelcast MR tutorial webinar available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCZGKoBoXsg)

## Hazelcast 3.3
Parts of the tutorial sourcecode are written in Java 8 (using Lambas to make the code more visible / readable) so Java 8 is
required to compile and execute those tutorial codes.

It also uses Hazelcast 3.3 syntax on map reduce and the recently merged aggregations, so depending on when you look at this
tutorial code you probably have to use a Hazelcast 3.3 RC1 snapshot or later.
